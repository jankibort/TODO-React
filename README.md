##### This is some type of TO:DO list. Got anything to do ? - go ahead and use this service. 

How to run / build project?:
- download https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- go to project dir
- npm install 
- npm start
- service should be available on localhost:3000

If you want to use this on own firebase -> edit firebase.initializeApp() located in index.js.

Why does the service looks exactly that way?

Features that would make service more comfy in future:
- order / group data in table by chosen column
- task deadline
- search tool that allows to filter more flexible way - for example: by fragment of description

Due to basic knowledge and time limit left some warnings in console and didn't keep code cleanest way (seperated components). This might be fixed in future.
